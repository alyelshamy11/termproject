# Group 137 Term Project
Our team wants to focus on the time management/inventory system domains with an emphasis
on health/medicine by creating a program to manage medications and remind users to take
their medications. Users would log their medications and other pertinent information
regarding scheduling/inventory, and the program would generate automatic reminders/scheduled
events for taking the medication and restocking. We are interested in using the Google Calendar
API to help with scheduling, and may also implement the openFDA API to obtain information about medications.
