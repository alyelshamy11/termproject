# Group 137 Term Project- MedBay
Our team will be creating a time management/inventory system for medications, hopefully utilizing APIs for cross-checking potential medication interactions, medication information database access, and Google Calendar integration. Users will log their medications and other pertinent information regarding scheduling/inventory. The program then checks for possible interactions between newly entered medications and stored medications (via API), raising a warning if there are potential conflicts. If no warning is raised, the program will generate automatic reminders/scheduled events on the userâ€™s Google Calendar (via API) for taking the medication and restocking. The program also contains an in-program table containing all given information (with current dose inventory counters) with a link to the FDA page of each medication information (via API), as well as a checklist of all medications/restockings to take/do for the current day (where checking a task off will update the table and Google Calendar accordingly).
