# Group 137 Term Project
Our team wants to focus on the time management/inventory system domains with an emphasis on health/medicine by creating a program to manage medications and remind users to take their medications. Users would log their medications and other pertinent information regarding scheduling/inventory, and the program would generate automatic reminders/scheduled events for taking the medication and restocking. We are interested in using the Google Calendar API to help with scheduling, and may also implement the openFDA API to obtain information about medications.
